# Problems for Spring 2017 ACM Code Competition

We're planning on having 20 questions total, so write a lot of them!

Each problem should have:

- a description
- an estimated difficulty level
- 4-6 test cases
- a solution in at least two languages (C++, Python, or whatever)

--------------

### Running test cases

To run a test case `testCase0.txt` on a solution, pipe the test case
to the solution's executable:

C++
    cat testCase0.txt | ./solution

Python
    cat testCase0.txt | python solution.py
