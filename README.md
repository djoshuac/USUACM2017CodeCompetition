# Problems for Spring 2017 ACM Code Competition

We're planning on having 20 questions total, so write a lot of them!

Each problem should have:

- a description
- an estimated difficulty level
- 4-6 test cases
- a solution in at least two languages (C++, Python, or whatever)

Put each problem in it's own folder named with following this example:

`best_words-20`

is a problem named "Best Words" that has a difficulty of 20 minutes.

--------------

### Running test cases

To run a test case `testCase0.txt` on a solution, pipe the test case
to the solution's executable:

C++
    cat testCase0.txt | ./solution

Python
    cat testCase0.txt | python solution.py

----------------

### Difficulty Scale

With teams of 3 and 4 hours to code, to complete each problem each person
on a team can spend no more than 36 minutes on each problem.

Gauge difficulty in the estimated number of minutes that it would take
one person to solve the question. For example:

> If a problem takes 25 minutes, it has a difficulty of 25

_NOTE: We need to make sure we don't overestimate or underestimate difficulty_
