Alclead and Eurgorythm seeds are heavily controlled substances in your country
due to the deadly poison produced from a mixture of the two plants pollens. If
fact only one pollen grain from each can wipe out entire an entire city (and has
is the past). As a result, Alclead and Eurgorythm cultivation is only
entrusted to the most skilled botanists. Having dedicated your life to the
study of these dangerous plants, you are among the few authorized by the Empress
to grow them.

The regulations followed to cultivate new seeds is simple enough. A messenger
delivers a letter sealed with the Crest of Her Highness. Within the letter is
the desired target of Alclead and Eurgorythm seeds and the number of allotted
Alclead and Eurgorythm seeds for the process. You are then given 1 months time
to prepare a special greenhouse. After which the seeds are delivered discretely
and securely.

Ah, Alclead and Eurgorythm plants! You remember how only 1 type can be grown
at a time (for safety). You also remember their peculiar reproduction:

* 1 Alclead plant produces 1 Alclead seed and 1 Eurgorythm seed
* 1 Eurgorythm plant produces 1 Alclead seed and 1 Eurgorythm seed

* Alclead plants take 1 month to fruit
* Eurgorythm plants take 2 months to fruit

Since the pollen's reactivity wears off over time, 1 month must be spent to
purify the greenhouse waiting for the pollens poison to wear off.

Recently you have developed a magical machine, able to compute many operations
in a short amount of time. The Empresses court is woefully inept in maths, and
always requires you to re-compute how many months it will take you to produce the target
seeds. You've decided to program one of your computing machines to do the maths
for them.

### Input

- the allotted number of Alclead seeds `a`
- the allotted number of Eurgorythm seeds `e`
- the target number of Alclead seeds `b`
- the target number of Eurgorythm seeds `f`

### Output

- -1 if it's impossible to produce the exact target from the allotted seeds
- Otherwise, an integer of the number of months it will take you
