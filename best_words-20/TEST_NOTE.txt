when I ran 1000000_testCase.txt it took my machine about 14 seconds which is too long
(hackerrank's limit for python is 10 seconds), so that test case might be too big to put on hackerrank.

All the others should execute in less than 4 seconds

Except the lots_of_tracksTest.txt which has 100 tracks of size 20000 which took around 7 seconds
