# Pseudo-code for solution
'''
load the words for each speech:
  keep track of how many times each speech uses a word
find each speech's best word:
  iterate through each speech:
    check each word in that speech that no other speech uses:
      compare it with the current best word:
      if it's better (higher word count OR used the same and has higher lexicographical value):
        set the new best word
